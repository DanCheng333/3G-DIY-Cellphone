===========

Hardware for a 3G cellphone based on GSM/GPRS Arduino shield and damellis' DIY Cellphone.

[David A Mellis' DIY Cellphone 2G 'Cellphone Module'](http://web.media.mit.edu/~mellis/gsm/)

That project uses the 2G Quectel M10 Module which is pin compatible with the 3G Quectel UC15 Module.

**Differences**

1. Slightly different 3.3V-4.3V (UC15) vs 3.3V-4.6V (M10). Using a 3.7V battery is fine. MCP73831 recharges the 3.7V battery from the USB ... if the unit is powered off USB, it's at 4.2V which is on the high end. which is a little too close for comfort so I'd want to replace it with a USIM is the same. 

1. Frequency bands are slightly different but not much.

1. Pinout from controller will have to change. 

**Vocabulary**

GSM - Global System for Mobile Communications, 2G  
GPRS - General Packet Radio Services, packet data service on 2G and 3G  
UMTS - Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, 3G  
HSDPA - High-Speed Downlink Packet Access, allows higher speeds 3G speeds
